1. What is Quantitative Macroeconomics?
Quantitative macroeconomics combines modern theoretica macroeconomics (structural macroeconomic models) with state-of-the-art econometric models. 
Using methods of quantitative macroeconomics, we are equipped to study:
(1) The propagation/dynamic effects of economic shocks via impulse response analysis
(2) The sources of fluctuations by quantifying the importance of shocks in explaining the variations in the endogenous variables via variance decompositions
(3) The importance of a shock in driving the behavior of endogenous variables in a specific time period in the past via historical decompositions
(4) Counterfactual policies
(5) How to forecast/predict future values of the variables
In principles all of these purposes of modern quantitative macro can be done by using structura vector autoregression models 

2. What are Structural Vector Autoregressive models?
VAR models consist of systems of regression equation, in which each model variable is regressed on lags of its own as well as lags of other model variables. 
A VAR is a reduced form representation of the true data generating, which expresses the current values of the data as linear function of its own and other variables lagged values.
The component of the observables, which is linearly unpredictable, is given by an innovation vector. 
A structural VAR expresses those reduced-form errors as linear combinations of structural shocks with a causal economic interpretation. 
As such it is assumed that the variation in the data is driven by those mutually uncorrelated shocks. 
In other words, structural means that we are dealing with VARs that are assumed to be generated by an economic model structure that makes restrictions on stochastic processes. 
A researcher typically has the challenge that he cannot directly estimate a structural VAR, but only the reduced-form representation, which is typically easier to obtained from the data. 
In order to recover the recover the structural representation of the VAR, the researcher must impose suitable identifying restrictions. 
One of these identifying restrictions, I already mentioned: The mutually independence of the shocks. The two main further approaches for imposing restrictions are short- and long-run restrictions. 
The idea for the former is that there is a natural timing in the effect of economic shocks. The idea for the latter is to impose restricitions on long-run effects of economic shocks.

The development of SVARs started with the work of Sims (1980), who criticized the standard approach of estimating equations of large-scale macro models one-by-one in macroeconometrics since the 1950s.
His idea was to estimate the endogenous model variables jointly rather than one equation at a time. 
The VAR framework was suitable for that approach, while decomposing the forecast error into strauctural shocks - mutually uncorrelated with an economic interpretation - gave structure to the cross-equation restrictions.
The validity of the economic interpertability of our shocks and dynamics of endogenous variables depends on the validity of the identifiying restrictions used to isolate estimates of agent's behavior.

3. What ae Dynamic Stochastic General Equlibrium models?
DSGE models use modern macro theory to predict and explain co-movement of aggregate time series. 
They are build upon the behavior of forward-looking optimizing agents, equipped with rational expectations - the so-called micro-foundations of modern macroeconomics. 
The combination of economic decisions taken by all agents results in the dynamic equilibrium. 
Examples for agents, that are typically included are utility-maximizing households, profit-maximizing or cost-minimizing firms, monetary and fiscal policy institutions and so on.
The opimization problems are then solved under uncertainty via adding stochastic processes to the system of equations.

Its name-giving features are that:
- The equations must always hold (General equilibrium): In short-run, decisions, quantities and prices adjust s.t. equations are full-filled. In long-run, variable values are equal to its steady state, e.g. on its balanced growth path
- (Stochastic) Shocks provide devations of the system from its steady-state,  which thus create business cycles
- Since agents are forward-looking and solve intertemporal decision problems, and the propagation of shocks through the economy and its return to steady-state takes, a dynamic analysis is necessary
