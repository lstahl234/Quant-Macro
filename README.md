# Quant-Macro
# Repository for Quantitative Macroeconomics
In this repository I will practice estimating SVAR and DSGE models.
The folder contains examples and codes developed in the lecture.
I also don't ger git and this really cumbersome! Dorpbox, iCloud, Nextcloud and OneDrive is so much better!
